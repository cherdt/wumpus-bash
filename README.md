=======================

Just for fun.

How to Play

Type `HELP` or `?` or `what do I do now` in the game for further instructions.

Background
----------
The original version of Hunt the Wumpus was created by Gregory Yob in 1972. I never played the original, I've only read about it.

I made a Javascript version at [https://osric.com/wumpus/], but I felt it was not true to the original, so I made this one that may be slightly more authentic.
